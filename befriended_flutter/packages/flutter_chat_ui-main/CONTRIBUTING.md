# Contributing to Flyer Chat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flyer Chat! Our vision is to create an easy-to-use chat experience for any application and while we can't have everything right from the start, we can build it together! If you plan to implement a feature and open a pull request, make sure you don't spend a lot of time on it, otherwise open an issue so we can discuss bigger stuff.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project.

## Helping with Documentation

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to build our documentation which is located in the [doc](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/doc) folder. If you are adding new functionality or introducing a behavior change, we will ask you to update the documentation to reflect your changes.

## Contributing Code

Code-level contributions to Flyer Chat generally come in the form of pull requests. These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally. Directly in the repo, there is the [example](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/example) project that you can install on your device (or simulators) and use to test the changes you're making to Flyer Chat sources.
