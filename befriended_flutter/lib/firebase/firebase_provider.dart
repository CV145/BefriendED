/*
Firebase Realtime Database
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as
JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build
cross-platform apps with our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs,
all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically
receive updates with the newest data.

Realtime:
Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Realtime Database uses data
synchronizationâ€”every time data changes, any connected device receives that
update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences
without thinking about networking code.

Offline:
Firebase apps remain responsive even when offline because the Firebase
Realtime Database SDK persists your data to disk. Once connectivity is
reestablished, the client device receives any changes it missed, synchronizing
it with the current server state.
